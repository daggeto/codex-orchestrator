# codex-orchestrator

Most multi-agent setups are demos. You spawn three agents, they chat at each other for 45 seconds, produce a wall of "I'll get right on that!" and "Great suggestion!", and nothing actually happens.

This is the opposite. Persistent agents with dedicated processes, strict prompts that reject noise, and workspace isolation so they don't step on each other. Codex instances run as WebSocket servers on their own ports. Claude sessions resume across turns. The orchestrator manages the lifecycle, routes work, and makes sure every response contains an actual deliverable; commits, test results, file changes, or a clear review decision.

## What's actually here

**Agents** run as long-lived processes. Codex gets a `codex app-server --listen ws://127.0.0.1:PORT` per instance. Claude gets subprocess sessions with `--resume` for persistence. Threads carry context across turns; you can send a follow-up message to the same thread hours later.

**Roles** define what each agent does. Architect reads the codebase and designs plans (read-only sandbox). Implementer writes code (workspace-write sandbox, gets its own git worktree). Reviewer checks the work (read-only, must end with APPROVED or CHANGES_REQUESTED). QA runs tests. Planner decomposes tasks. All configured via TOML files.

**Supervision** is not a separate agent; it's how the orchestrator talks. Every response gets checked for deliverables vs noise. If an implementer says "I'll get right on that!" instead of producing file changes, the orchestrator sends a direct correction and retries. Reviewers that don't produce a clear decision get bounced back.

**Workspace isolation** via git worktrees. Write agents get their own branch per work item. Read agents share the main repo. No file conflicts, no race conditions. Merge back when approved, cleanup when rejected.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zm2231/codex-orchestrator.git
cd codex-orchestrator
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

Needs `codex` CLI for Codex agents and/or `claude` CLI for Claude agents.

## Usage

```bash
# Start with a team
orch start --spawn-team architect --spawn-team implementer --spawn-team reviewer

# Talk to agents by role
orch send architect "Design an auth system for this project" --cwd /path/to/repo

# Supervised mode (rejects filler, enforces deliverables)
orch supervised-send implementer "Fix the N+1 query in user list" --cwd /path/to/repo

# Run a multi-agent workflow
orch workflow run feature -v task_description="Add OAuth login" --cwd /path/to/repo
orch workflow run bugfix -v task_description="Race condition in sessions" --cwd /path/to/repo

# Skills (reusable prompt templates with verification)
orch skill run code-review reviewer -v diff="$(git diff)" --cwd /repo
orch skill run investigate-bug architect -v bug_description="OOM on large uploads" --cwd /repo
```

## Roles

| Role | Backend | Sandbox | What it does |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|
| architect | codex | read-only | Designs, plans, reviews architecture |
| implementer | codex | workspace-write | Writes code, runs commands, commits |
| reviewer | codex | read-only | Code review; must produce APPROVED or CHANGES_REQUESTED |
| qa | codex | workspace-write | Runs tests, verifies fixes, checks regressions |
| planner | claude | read-only | Decomposes tasks into work items with priorities |

Edit `roles/*.toml` to change models, sandbox, token budgets, system prompts.

## Workflows

Four built-in pipelines:

- **feature**: architect plans, implementer codes, reviewer checks, revision loop if rejected
- **bugfix**: architect investigates, implementer fixes, qa verifies
- **review**: send code to reviewer
- **research**: parallel investigation by multiple agents, then synthesis

## HTTP API

Runs on `:8420` with `orch start`. REST endpoints for everything, plus SSE event stream at `/api/events`.

```bash
# Spawn an agent
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8420/api/agents -d '{"role": "architect"}'

# Send a message
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8420/api/send/implementer \
  -d '{"message": "Add input validation", "cwd": "/path/to/repo"}'

# Check worktree diffs
curl http://127.0.0.1:8420/api/workspaces/{id}/diff

# Merge approved work
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8420/api/workspaces/{id}/merge -d '{"strategy": "squash"}'

# Stream all events
curl -N http://127.0.0.1:8420/api/events
```

## What it looks like in practice

Ran the orchestrator against a TODO API with intentional bugs. Three agents, three ports, one repo:

1. **Architect** (read-only, port 9001, 64s): analyzed the codebase, found ID reuse after deletion, missing input validation, no auth on DELETE, stub tests with no real coverage
2. **Implementer** (workspace-write, port 9002, 142s): worked in an isolated worktree on branch `orch/8bef2a4f/fix-bugs`, added validation and error handling, wrote 9 tests, committed `f1c44cb`
3. **Reviewer** (read-only, port 9003, 82s): reviewed the diff against the original findings, found 2 HIGH issues the implementer missed (auth still absent on DELETE, non-object JSON payloads crash the validator)

The worktree stays on its branch until merged. The reviewer's feedback would loop back to the implementer in the normal workflow.
